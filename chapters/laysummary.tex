\chapter{Lay Summary}

While people communicate to one another by speaking or writing in natural languages,
we communicate with computers via programming languages to tell them to, say, perform a calculation.
Just as what is said or written needs to be grammatically correct to make any sense,
programs written in these programming languages need to be checked to ensure that they behave nicely.
One desirable property of programs might be termination:
we want to be certain that they will eventually finish running at some point.
It's impossible to devise a check that can always pick out all terminating programs,
but termination checks can be improved upon to accept more and more programs.
The topic of this thesis is using \emph{sized types}, a powerful strategy for termination checking,
in the setting of a programming language for mathematicians to write computer-verified proofs,
and proving that the programs it accepts will actually terminate.
