\chapter{Acknowledgements}

I'd like to thank the following people for their support throughout the past two years:

\begin{itemize}
  \item William Bowman.
  \item Lily Bryant, for guidance and resources on proving confluence.
  \item Jordy Dickinson, for exposing me to all sorts of niches of type theory and constructive mathematics,
    and for giving an ear to the most out-of-context problems I was working on.
    I hope you're doing well.
  \item Hazel Levine, for making \href{https://types.pl/}{types.pl} a reality (and letting me in on the fun).
  \item The folks on PL Twitter, the TYPES, Coq, Agda, Idris, and Cedille mailing lists and Zulips,
    and the Proof Assistants Stack Exchange for answering my many questions
    and for asking far more interesting ones.
  \item Finally and most importantly, all my other splabmates at the Software Practices Lab
    for making grad school a way better experience than I could have hoped for,
    especially during an ongoing global pandemic.
    To name a few (by increasing order of name length):
