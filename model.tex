\FigSyntaxCIC{fig:syntax-cic}
The target langauge, \CICE, is CIC with a separate propositional equality construct
that is reflected into definitional equality.
Its syntax is given in \cref{fig:syntax-cic}.
Aside from the standard dependent functions,
it has a fixpoint expression with the 0-based index of the recursive argument explicitly given,
a $\target{case}$ expression whose motive is additionally abstracted over the indices of the target's inductive type,
and an equality type with the reflexivity constructor and $\target{\J*}$ eliminator.
New inductive types are defined using data definitions $\target{D}$,
whose syntax resembles the informal presentation used in \cref{ch:sized-dep-types}.

The well-formedness conditions on inductive data definitions,
such as well-typedness and \emph{strict positivity}\index{strict positivity},
are entirely standard, so I don't detail them here;
see pCuIC~\citep{pCuIC} for instance for a full description.
Inductive definitions in their full generality are not needed,
and nonmutual, nonnested inductives suffice.
Indeed, only five inductive definitions are used for the translation,
for representing sizes, their order, their well-foundedness,
and naturals and well-founded trees.
